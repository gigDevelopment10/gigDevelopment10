### SDE@Blackrock | MS CS Georgia Tech

Hey There, 

Hi, I’m Zoya! I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science at Georgia Tech (OMSCS) while working full-time as a Software Engineer at BlackRock, contributing to the Aladdin Wealth Tech product engineering team.

I completed my B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science from Vishwakarma Institute of Technology (NAAC A++), Pune, India.

Throughout my career, I’ve had the opportunity to win and participate in several competitions, including the Vodafone Idea Innovation Challenge, Smart India Hackathon, Veritas U Connect Hackathon, and more.

I enjoy building impactful solutions and collaborating on exciting ideas. If you have an interesting idea, let’s turn it into reality over a cup of coffee and some code.
